> *"What if your operating system was infinite-dimensional?"*

## 🚀 Vision

YUR OS is a revolutionary **spatial operating system** that transforms how humans interact with information. Built on infinite-dimensional mathematics, it creates a **mandala-based interface** where every app, file, and thought exists in semantic proximity - making your digital life as intuitive as physical space.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🌸 **Mandala Dock**
- Apps arranged in sacred geometric patterns
- Semantic clustering by usage and relationship
- Infinite zoom into fractal app hierarchies

### 🌊 **Fractal Navigation**
- Zoom from galaxy-view of all data to atomic details
- Every level reveals new organizational structures
- Natural spatial memory for information retrieval

### 📝 **Spatial Apps**
- **Docs**: Markdown editor with 3D file explorer
- **Connect**: Social networks in spatial proximity
- **Pay**: Financial flows as energy currents
- **Mind**: Thoughts mapped in cognitive space
- **Maps**: Geographic and conceptual navigation
- **Rewards**: Achievement constellations

### 🥽 **Multi-Reality**
- Desktop: Traditional windowing with spatial enhancements
- Browser: PWA with WebXR capabilities
- Mobile: Touch-optimized mandala interface
- AR/VR: Full spatial computing environment

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Three.js + PWA
- **Spatial Engine**: Custom infinite-dimensional operators
- **Desktop**: Electron wrapper
- **Mobile**: Progressive Web App
- **XR**: WebXR + spatial computing primitives
